<p>The approach that originated the QualiSWBES tool was developed based on research carried out on the quality assessment models in the literature, both those that evaluate software, Web education systems, interface, and those that evaluate learning objects and Semantic Web technologies ontologies). </p>
<p>In addition, the international standards ISO / IEC SQuaRE 25000 and those adopted by the W3C were considered, which contributed to establishing and defining the factors and criteria that made up the approach created. </p>
<p>Finally, because it is an approach that evaluates SWBES, the Nielsen Heuristics and Shneiderman Gold Rules have also been analyzed, since usability is a characteristic of the quality of the system that contributes to facilitate its use by users, mainly students, and allows they to focus on learning the content and not spend time and effort to learn how to use the tool. </p>
<p>In this way, the factors and criteria were adjusted, and the artifacts and evaluators responsible for the evaluation process were defined.</p>
<ul><li>The factors evaluated are adaptability, interoperability, customization, reusability and usability.</li>
<li>The Artifacts are: ontologies, learning objects, interface and software.</li>
<li>The Evaluators are: knowledge / ontologies engineers), developers, authors, teachers, tutors, students and managers.</li></ul>
<p>Thus, from a SWBES repository, stakeholders will be able to use the tool to evaluate the systems, according to established quality factors and to make the most appropriate choice for their needs. </p>';

<p>The QualiSWBES Web tool was developed to automate the approach designed to assess the quality of Semantic Web-based educational systems (SWBES). From a SWBES repository, the various professionals and users (developers, authors, teachers, tutors, managers of educational institutions, students, etc.) who need to acquire or elect a SWBES to use, will be able to make the choice based on the result of the quality evaluation of each system, performed through QualiSWBES.</p><br>

<b> Interoperability </b> - refers to: the ability of two or more systems to interact and exchange data with each other; to the degree of information sharing through some tools, such as proper markup language, metadata usage, and metadata architectures. </br>
<b> Customization </b> - refers to the degree to which the artefact is adapted to the use\'r needs (language, design, etc.); to the degree to which each user has their own vision of the educational system through the semantic annotation of the concepts used and generated during the learning process; the generation and retrieval of feedback from the context data of the annotated learning content. </br>
<b> Reusability </b> - refers to the degree of reuse of the artefact in several different systems and contexts, for different purposes in learning, not exclusively for which it was conceived; to the use of any artefact, already produced, in the construction of another system (OA, ontologies, source code, requirements, UML diagrams, tests, manual, etc.). </br>
<b> Usability </b> - refers to: the ease that users have in learning how to use the artefact to achieve their goals and how satisfied they are with the process; the ease of learning, the efficiency in use, the ease of memorizing, the robustness; the degree of standardization of the system; the ease of navigation and the quality of the interface\'s help features.';
