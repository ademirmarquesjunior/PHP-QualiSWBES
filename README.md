Abstract: 
The Web education systems (WES) global community is in continuous change,
 growth and evolve all around the world, driven by several factors, including
 new trends in emerging technologies and tools that support WES, and even the
 growing role of social learning as a priority for the development process of
 such systems. Semantic Web-based Educational Systems (SWBES) are Web-based
 educational platforms designed to address a variety of problems faced by
 students and other users, such as difficulties in finding, sharing, and
 reusing educational resources. SWBES have often been used as search engines
 for MOOC platforms and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Therefore,
 ensuring the quality of these systems is necessary to enable better teaching
 and learning experiences. However, SWBES quality assessment is a complex
 task, since it requires extensive knowledge about Semantic Web technologies,
 Web Educational Systems, Software Engineering, and software quality assessment
 standards. The problem identified was the absence of a quality evaluation
 approach of these systems from the elements of the system architecture, ie,
 the role and structure of intelligent agents, ontologies, learning objects,
 repositories, metadata etc. In this context, the purpose of this thesis was
 to develop an approach for the quality evaluation of SWBES. In order to
 achieve the proposed objective, it was necessary to identify the quality
 criteria used in software quality assessment, WES (including educational
 resources, such as learning objects), Semantic Web technologies (such as
 ontologies). These criteria were classified, analyzed and adjusted, based
 on the quality requirements of SWBES in the literature and named as factors.
 Next, a set of quality factors was established, with subfactors and criteria
 that will be used as a general guideline to evaluate and compare the quality
 of SWBES. The evaluators designated to evaluate the SWBES were defined
 according to the role they represent in the systems. It was also established
 which SWBES artifacts should be evaluated by the approach, in order of making
 the evaluation process simplified. It was developed a Web tool to automate
 the approach developed which were validated through case studies by
 specialists in the related research fields. It is expected that the approach
 will contribute with professionals, developers and other users (teachers,
 educators, students, virtual tutors and managers) in acquiring and using
 SWBES, so that they can choose the appropriate system to fill out their
 needs and goals. In addition, it is expected to collaborate in the SWBES
 development process, based on the quality factors established, and promoting
 quality assurance since the beginning of the development process. As future
 work, it is intended to broaden the quality factors and extend the approach
 allowing the evaluation of other Semantic Web-based Systems in other
 knowledge domain.
